# log
Very simple, header file for logging output from C++14. I have tried to keep it as short and as simple as possible.
Timed output is there for dealing with long running applications.

As of now, there are no plans to add a log-to-file feature.

## NB
The only change that might be required is in the ```getNormalHeader``` function, which is custom built for my current purposes.

# TODO
* Add a Makefile, (I know, right!? It's quite straight forward, but as of now, I'm just too lazy to create a bare-basic Makefile. :D I'm using a CMakeLists.txt in my project, but that has grown monstrous, so no, I'm not putting that up here)
